Research Purpose

The goal of this study is to begin to better characterize how our value of choice and decision-making is affected by social contexts.   



Description of the Research

You will be asked to take part in a computerized task in which the photographs you included and uploaded prior to participation in the study will be shared with an anonymous partner. You will receive feedback from your partner after your photos are shown. The feedback may come in the form of being liked or disliked. Any photos submitted to the study will be immediately discarded upon completion of the study. You will then be given the option to make a series of choices in a lottery game or decline and have the computer participate in the task on your behalf. You will also be asked to complete a series of self-report questionnaires which may ask about your social experiences, personality and substance use either at the beginning or end of the session.

 Your participation in this study will last approximately 2 hours, split over the course of 2 days depending on how quickly you complete the tasks.   


Potential Risks

There are no known risks associated with your participation in this study.  You may experience mild discomfort from performing a computer task for up to one hour (i.e., strained eyes); however, there will be rest periods during the course of the experimental session to mediate any discomfort of this sort. You are able to withdraw from participation at any time if you feel any discomfort at all without penalty to you.   


Potential Benefits

There are no direct benefits to you for participating in this study.  Your participation will help us  

understand how we are affected by different social contexts and how this may influence subsequent decisions. The findings from this set of studies may be helpful in understanding how social influence can have both positive and negative effects on our behavior, as well as our emotional and mental well-being.    



Costs/Compensation

You will receive compensation for your participation in this study in the form of monetary compensation at the rate specified when you entered into the survey online on Prolific (e.g., up to $10 per hour) or in the posted advertisement. You may also be eligible for bonus pay based on your choices and successfully completing the task (e.g.,a bonus of up to $5). 



Additional Information

Contact Persons

If you have any questions, at any time, about this research, or want to discuss any  

possible study-related injuries, please contact Dr. Dominic Fareri at telephone number  

516-877-4824.  If you experience any distress as a result of participation in this study, youmay  

seek out additional assistance by contacting Adelphi University’s Student Counseling  

Center at 516-877-3646, located in the University Center, Rm 310.  You can also contact the Adelphi University Center for Psychological Services at 516-877-4820, located in the Hy Weinberg Center.   



Confidentiality

Your identity as a participant in this research study will be kept confidential in any publication of the results of this study. The information obtained during this research (research records) will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law. However, this research record may be reviewed by government agencies (such as the Department of Health and Human Services), the agency sponsoring this research, individuals who are authorized to monitor or audit the research, or the Institutional Review Board (the committee that oversees all research in human subjects at Adelphi University) if required by applicable laws or regulations.  The material will be maintained for up to 7 years.   

 

All data from this study will be stored on a password-protected computer and securely backed up on a password-protected external drive. Only the PI and designated personnel on the research team will have access to participants’ data.  All participants will be given a unique identifier to ensure confidentiality.  The key linking participants’ unique identifier and any protected information will be kept in a locked file cabinet separately from any data.  Only the PI and designated members of the research team will have access to this key.   


Data Deposition at the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive.  

This study is funded by the National Institute of Mental Health.  Data from this study will be submitted to the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive (NDA), a data repository run by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) that allows researchers studying mental health and substance use to collect and share de-identified information with each other. A data repository is a large database where information from many studies is stored and managed. With an easier way to share, researchers hope to learn new and important things about brain science and mental health more quickly than before. During and after the study, the researchers will send de-identified information about your health and behavior to NDA. Other researchers nationwide can then file an application with the NIMH to obtain access to your de-identified study data for research purposes. Experts at the NIMH who know how to protect health and science information will look at every request carefully to minimize risks to your privacy.  

 

You may not benefit directly from allowing your information to be shared with NDA. The information provided to NDA may help researchers find better treatments. NIMH will also report to Congress and on its web site about the different studies that researchers are conducting using NDA data. However, you will not be contacted directly about the data you contributed to NDA.  

 

You may decide now or later that you do not want to share your information using NDA. If so, contact the researchers who conducted this study, and they will tell NDA, which can stop sharing the research information. However, NDA cannot take back information that was shared before you changed your mind. If you would like more information about NDA, this is available on-line at http://dataarchive.nimh.gov. 

 

The data we share with the general public will not have your name on it, only a code number, so people will not know your name or which data are yours. In addition, we will not share any other information that we think might help people who know you guess which data are yours. If you change your mind and withdraw your consent to participate in this study (you can call Dr. Fareri at 516-877-4824 to do this), we will not collect any additional data about you. We will delete your data if you withdraw before it was deposited in the database. However, any data and research results already shared with other investigators or the general public cannot be destroyed, withdrawn or recalled.  

 

It is possible that some of the research conducted using your information eventually could lead to the development of new methods for studying the brain, new diagnostic tests, new drugs or other commercial products. Should this occur, there is no plan to provide you with any part of the profits generated from such products and you will not have any ownership rights in the products.  

 

To the best of our knowledge, the data we release to the general public will not contain information that can directly identify you. The data will not have your name on it, only a code number, so people will not know your name or which data are yours. In addition, the data will not include data that we think might help people who know you guess which data are yours, such as your facial features or the date that you participated. If we write a report or article about this study or share the study data set with others, we will do so in such a way that you cannot be directly identified. However, by using additional data linked to your name, one could potentially associate your information in our database back to you*. In addition, a security breach (break in or cyber attack) might lead to someone being able to link you to your data. This risk is very low because your data are stored in a secure database, and the information about your identity is stored separately from the data themselves, linked only through a code.  


Voluntary Participation

Participation in this study is voluntary. You will be able to terminate your participation in this  

study at any time with no penalty to you.   


Institutional Review Board Approval

This research has been reviewed and approved by the Adelphi University Institutional Review Board.  If you have any questions, concerns or comments, please contact the IRB chair, Dr. Carolyn Springer, 516-877-4753, springer@adelphi.edu.
